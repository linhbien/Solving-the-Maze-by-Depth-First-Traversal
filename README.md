# Solving-the-Maze-by-Depth-First-Traversal
In this project, I would like to introduce how to apply Depth First Search in solving the Maze.
The problem is to find whether we can go from the start position to the destination position in the maze. 
There are some examples to explain how to apply this algorithm, including diagram and programming.
Depth First Search is a useful algorithm which is used in cycle detection in graphs, and solving puzzles with only one solution, such as a maze.
DFS consumes less space memory than Breath First Search. 
DFS will reach at the goal node in a less time if go to the right path
